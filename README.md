# Smart-Internz-Projects

There are many users of online trading platforms and these companies would like to run analytics on and predict churn based on user activity on the platform. Since competition is rife, keeping customers happy so they do not move their investments elsewhere is key to maintaining profitability.

In this notebook, we'll use scikit-learn to predict classes. scikit-learn provides implementations of many classification algorithms. In here, we have chosen the random forest classification algorithm to walk through all the different steps.

To help visualize what we are doing, we'll use 2D and 3D charts to show how the classes look (with 3 selected dimensions) with matplotlib and scikitplot python libraries.
